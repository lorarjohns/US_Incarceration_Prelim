"Note: Estimates are rounded to the nearest 100 and may not be comparable to previously published BJS reports due to updated information or rounding. Counts include estimates for nonresponding jurisdictions. All probation, parole, and prison counts are for December 31, except where noted; jail counts are for the last weekday in June. Detail may not sum to total due to rounding and adjustments made to account for offenders with dual correctional statuses. See Methodology. See the Key Statistics page on the BJS website for correctional population statistics prior to 2000 or other years excluded in this table. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
